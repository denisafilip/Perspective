# Perspective

Perspective is an application destined to broaden the horizon of its users, through informal messages and specialized resources. Based on the quote *There are no truths, only perspective*, the application means to enforce the idea that there are more sides to a story, depending on who is telling it. A user can converse freely about a topic chosen from a set of discussion subjects, with another user that either shares the same perspective or is situated on the other end of the spectrum. A discussion topic can range from statements, such as *A four-day work week is more effective*, to entire subjects, such as vegetarianism, destiny, cooking, and anything in between.  
  
When talking with somebody with the same opinion, they can delve deeper into the subject and grow their knowledge regarding it. If discussing with somebody with a different opinion, they can listen to valid arguments about it and spark a debate.  
  
Other ways to overcome the limitations of your mind is through reading books and articles, listening to podcasts and watching videos. These resources are posted by qualified experts, that are a source of valuable information about the given topic.
